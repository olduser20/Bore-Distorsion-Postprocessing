# Bore-Distorsion-Postprocessing
Post processing procedure for bore distortion calculations. It takes the geometry and deformation of a finite element simulation with pre-defined sets of nodes, plots the data, performs Fourier analysis and compares the results of each set.

Applicable to distortions of ICEs and pressure vessels.
